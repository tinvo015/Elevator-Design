# Elevator-Design
Final project for EE 271, designing an elevator on a DE1-SoC board.

User would give an input through the switches on the board, indicating the floor that he/she wants to go to. The elevator will then move to that floor with the LED lights showing the current level that the elevator is at. Each time the selected floor is reached, another input is needed to close the door and allow the elevator to move to another floor. Elevator will continue heading in one direction only before switching.
